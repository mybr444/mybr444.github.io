            <h1 id="firstheading">How Art Became My Favorite Hobby!</h1>

            <h2 class="headings">How I got into Art:</h2>

            <p>
                My name is Mykiesha, and my current favorite hobby is art (specifically drawing). I got into art randomly after picking up one of my friend’s sketch books and started drawing a character from one of my favorite shows. After I finished the sketch I didn’t think it was terrible, so I became eager to learn more and naturally my interest in drawing and art grew! I now enjoy drawing and other forms of art because I like to see my ideas come to life. Even though I struggle and stress over parts not turning out the way I envision it, I find that the results are often fulfilling.

            <h2 class="headings">Advice For Fellow Beginners:</h2>  

            <p>
                For someone who has never done art or tried to draw, I would first recommend looking up some different art styles and getting familiar with the basic art forms and mediums that exist. After that I would just start drawing. I think focusing to much on the studying part can be a hinderance to your development. Starting with basic shapes and techniques to see where your strengths and weaknesses are, and going from there. If it's realism, I would probably start with a fruit or an eye. If its illustration you could also start with fruit or an eye, it all depends on what you're comfortable drawing in the beginning. Personally, the most important lesson I’ve learned and still practicing would be that trying to be perfect stifles your growth. Grab a pencil or a paint brush and just do it.

            <h2 class="headings">Additional Resources I Love:</h2>

            <p>
                Some additional tips I would offer any other fellow art lovers is to use <a href="https://www.Pinterest.com">Pinterest.com</a>. This website was made for creatives and has certain types of inspiration and references that you might have a hard time finding anywhere else. I would also recommend not going out and buying the fanciest sketch book or supplies in general when starting art. Materials are important but it isn’t a priority at this stage, practice is. Another website I would suggest visiting is <a href="https://www.TikTok.com">Tiktok.com</a>. or <a href="https://www.Youtube.com">Youtube.com</a>. These sites have millions of tutorials by artist for artist, and for every art medium/style you can think of. <i>(All mentioned websites are also linked below!)</i>
